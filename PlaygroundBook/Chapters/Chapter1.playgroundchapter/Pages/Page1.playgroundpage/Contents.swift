 This kind of illusion is called **Anamorphic**. And they are full of history, science, math and art!
 
 ## Anamorph
 
 The simple way to create a anamorphic image is to start with a grid with squares and another grid with same number of cells stretched to a perspective desired. See it in the picture below:

 The drawing should be done in Grade 1 and therefore carefully moved to Grade 2 or 3. In this way, you will get a distorted version of the image which if viewed at the proper angle will be perceived exactly as the original.
 
 Easier than it looks, right? Art and Math working together.
 
 **Now, how about experiencing this?**
