## Hi, My name is Italo Boss!

I am Brazilian, 25 years old and currently studying Digital Systems and Media at Federal University of Ceara, an incredible course that mixes design and programming subjects for digital media. And I'm also an Apple Developer Academy student.
 
## Motivation

I've always loved science, especially mathematics and physics, and how fun it can be to study it. So I've come up with a way to bring my skills together in programming, design and my passion for these subjects.

With these ideas in mind **I challenged myself to use the AR Kit** because I've always wanted to learn more about it and found it a great opportunity to try out how to develop an Augmented Reality experience.

 **I hope you have learned while having fun!**
